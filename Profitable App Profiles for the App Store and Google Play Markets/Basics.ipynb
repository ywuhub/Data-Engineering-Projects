Thus, it can be said that the more customers we have, the higher the revenue.

It definitely seems that the most successful genres cater towards the younger generations because the latter genres such as Weather or Business are less popular and would be more inclined to be downloaded by older audiances.\n",

Despite games being the clear winner in terms of users, it also means there is an abundance of competitors, so it is better to focus on the next few genres."

But, as we know, this sector is heavily skewered towards to social behemoths that is Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Thus, it will require us to target a smaller niche in the social network genre to get a slice of the marketshare but when we do, we should gain a decent following."

The possible reason for this maybe because most of the installs will be only for a few apps such as Facebook or I"
